# IK_Baxter

Created by Dallin Colgrove and Bryan Jacobson
Used for ME 537 Robotics project at BYU

The purpose of this project is to develop the Inverse Kinimatics for Baxter by using the Psuedo-Inverse method. 

  First run the Matlab code with the Baxter model to get the joint angles of each position
  Then using the file joint.mat upload this with the python code called project_code.py onto the linx machine
  Run on baxter
